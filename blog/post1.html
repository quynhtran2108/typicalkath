        J-fashion is more than a look â€” it's a lifestyle rooted in creativity, individuality, and cultural expression.
        Whether you're drawn to the elegance of <strong>Lolita</strong>, the playful chaos of <strong>Decora</strong>,
        or the natural softness of <strong>Mori Kei</strong>, starting your collection can be exciting (and a little overwhelming).
        Here's how to begin with clarity and style.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Explore and Choose Your Style</h2>
      <p>Start by discovering which J-fashion substyle speaks to you most:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lolita</strong>: Frilly, doll-like, and elegant (Sweet, Gothic, Classic).</li>
        <li><strong>Gyaru</strong>: Trendy, bold, and glam.</li>
        <li><strong>Mori Kei</strong>: Soft layers and earthy, nature-inspired looks.</li>
        <li><strong>Decora / Fairy Kei</strong>: Bright colors, nostalgic accessories, and fun layering.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Do your research, follow fashion accounts, and save outfits that inspire you. Defining your style helps guide your future purchases.</p>

      <h2>2. Start with Versatile Basics</h2>
      <p>Build a mini wardrobe with a few key pieces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1-2 main items (like a dress or standout top)</li>
        <li>Coordinating accessories</li>
        <li>Shoes that work across several looks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Focus on quality and cohesion, not quantity. You can always grow your collection over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Shop Smart</h2>
      <p>Look for trusted sources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secondhand shops: <em>Closet Child, Wunderwelt</em></li>
        <li>Marketplaces: <em>Mercari Japan (via shopping services), Lace Market</em></li>
        <li>Indie brands & small businesses (like ours!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always check sizing (Japanese brands run small) and watch out for scam sites.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Connect with the Community</h2>
      <p>
        J-fashion is global â€” and welcoming. Join online groups, follow creators, and attend local or virtual events.
        The support, tips, and inspiration will keep you motivated and confident.

      <h2>5. Let Your Style Evolve</h2>
      <p>
        Your taste may shift, and that's okay! Building a J-fashion wardrobe is a journey. Enjoy the process and wear what makes you feel good.
