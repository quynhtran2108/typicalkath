        Secondhand clothing is a great way to build a stylish and sustainable wardrobe ‚Äî especially in J-fashion,
        where rare or vintage items can become treasured finds. But before you wear your new-to-you dress, jacket,
        or blouse, it's important to give it a proper clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some simple, effective tips to safely clean your secondhand clothing without damaging delicate fabrics or special details.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Check the Label First</h2>
      <p>
        Always look for the care tag. It'll usually tell you if an item should be hand washed, machine washed, or dry cleaned.
        If the tag is missing or written in Japanese, do a quick fabric check or look up similar items from the same brand.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When in doubt, hand wash or take it to a trusted dry cleaner.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Inspect for Damage</h2>
      <p>
        Before cleaning, inspect for loose threads, buttons, lace tears, or any fragile embellishments. Delicate trims and details
        are common in J-fashion, so handle them with care.
      </p>
      <p>You may want to mend or secure any loose parts before washing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Hand Washing is Often Safest</h2>
      <p>For most secondhand J-fashion items ‚Äî especially Lolita, Fairy Kei, or other embellished styles ‚Äî hand washing is the gentlest method.</p>
      <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use cold or lukewarm water</li>
        <li>Add a mild detergent (like one made for delicates or baby clothes)</li>
        <li>Soak gently for 5-10 minutes</li>
        <li>Rinse thoroughly</li>
        <li>Press (don't wring!) excess water out using a towel</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Machine Wash with Caution</h2>
      <p>
        If the item seems sturdy (like cotton shirts or simple skirts), you can machine wash it ‚Äî but protect it first.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a laundry bag</li>
        <li>Wash on a delicate cycle with cold water</li>
        <li>Avoid harsh detergents or bleach</li>
        <li>Never machine wash items with heavy lace, bows, or screen prints without checking first!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Dry Flat or Hang Carefully</h2>
      <p>
        Air drying is best. Lay items flat on a towel for delicate pieces, or hang them on padded hangers to avoid stretching.
        Keep them out of direct sunlight, which can cause fading ‚Äî especially with pastels or dark colors.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Avoid dryers</strong> unless the label specifically says it's safe.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Freshen Without Washing</h2>
      <p>
        Not every piece needs a full wash right away. If something looks and smells clean, try:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Light steaming to remove wrinkles and freshen up</li>
        <li>Hanging outdoors (in the shade) to air it out</li>
        <li>Using a fabric-safe spray like Febreze or vodka-water mix</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This works especially well for vintage pieces you don't want to over-wash.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Caring for secondhand clothing properly not only helps it last longer ‚Äî it also shows respect for the garment's
        history and craftsmanship. With the right cleaning routine, your J-fashion treasures can stay fresh, beautiful,
        and ready to wear for years to come.
